# KNN-ML-Learning

### KNN

KNN is a simple, supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks -

and is also frequently used in missing value imputation. It is based on the idea that the observations closest to a 

given data point are the most "similar" observations in a data set, and we can therefore classify unforeseen points 

based on the values of the closest existing points. By choosing K, the user can select the number of nearby 

observations to use in the algorithm.



### How does it work?

K is the number of nearest neighbors to use. For classification, a majority vote is used to determined which 

class a new observation should fall into. Larger values of K are often more robust to outliers and produce

more stable decision boundaries than very small values (K=3 would be better than K=1, which might produce 

undesirable results.
